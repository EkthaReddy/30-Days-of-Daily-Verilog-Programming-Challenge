# Daily Verilog Programming Challenge

### Overview

Welcome to the **Daily Verilog Programming Challenge** repository! Over the course of 31 days, I started my journey to enhance Verilog programming skills using Xilinx Vivado 2023.1 version Tool. This challenge was designed to strngthen my foundation in digital design and Verilog HDL by solving a variety of Verilog problems on a daily basis. What started as a daunting task soon turned into an engaging and rewarding experience, fostering consistency, discipline, and a deeper understanding of Verilog.

### Challenge Highlights

- **Duration:** 31 Days
- **Tools Used:** Xilinx Vivado Tool
- **Focus Areas:** Basic Verilog programming, combinational and sequential circuits, testbench creation, simulation, and synthesis.
- **Goals:**
  - Develop a strong foundation in Verilog HDL.
  - Gain proficiency in using Xilinx Vivado for design and simulation.
  - Build a habit of daily coding and problem-solving.
  - Engage with the community and share knowledge.

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge, containing the problem statements, Verilog code, and testbenches. Each folder includes:

- **Verilog Code:** The Verilog implementation of the solution. 
- **Testbench:** The testbench used to validate the solution.
- **Simulation Results:** Screenshots of the simulation results (where applicable).
- **Schematic Result:** Schematic view of the Design.
